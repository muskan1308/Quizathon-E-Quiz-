Things I learnt while making my first project using HTML,CSS,

Designing:
1. By default our width in div in css includes the sum of
width+padding+border contrary to the popular belief of only width.
So use,
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
in all your programs to avoid this problem.
